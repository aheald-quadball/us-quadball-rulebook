**Basics of the Game**

**QUADBALL™: AN OVERVIEW**

Quadball is a mixed gender contact sport with a unique mix of elements from rugby, dodgeball, wrestling, flag football, and other sports. A Quadball team is made up of at least seven athletes who play with brooms between their legs when in play. While the game can appear chaotic to the casual observer, once familiar with the basic rules, Quadball is an exciting sport to watch and even more exciting to play.

**POSITIONS OVERVIEW**

Each team has four chasers and two beaters in play at all times. One chaser is designated as the keeper. Each team sends one seeker into the game at the end of the seeker floor (See: 3.4.3. Seeker floor).

Keeper and Chaser overview

Chasers in play per team: Four, one of which is designated as the keeper.

Game ball used: Quadball

Headband color: Green (keeper) & White (chaser)

Objective: Throw, kick, or in any way propel the Quadball through the opposing team’s hoops to score ten points and prevent opponents from propelling the Quadball through their own hoops.

Beater overview

Beaters in play per team: Two

Game ball used: Dodgeball

Headband color: Black

Objective: Throw, kick, or in any way propel the dodgeballs to disrupt the flow of the game by “knocking out” other players.

Seeker overview

Seekers in play per team: One

Game ball used: Flag

Headband color: Yellow

Objective: Remove the flag from the flag runner to score 35 points.

**GAMEPLAY OVERVIEW**

Chasers

A. The chasers and keepers use the Quadball to score goals. Goals are worth ten points each.
B. Chasers advance the ball down the field by running with it, passing it to teammates, or kicking it.
C. Chasers defend against potential goals by the opposing team through positioning themselves or through initiating legal physical contact with other Chasers.
D. While in their team’s own keeper zone, the keeper is immune to the knockout effect and has several other specialized powers (See: 7.2.2. Keeper-specific powers). During this time, the keeper is considered to be a protected keeper. Otherwise, the keeper position is the same as the chaser position.

Beaters

A. The beaters use dodgeballs to disrupt the flow of the game by “knocking out” any player from the opposing team who does not have knockout immunity (See: 5.5.2. Claiming knockout immunity).

B. Any player hit by a dodgeball propelled by an opponent is out until they complete the knockout procedure, unless they have knockout immunity (See: 5.3.1. Knockout procedure).

Seekers

A. The seekers try to remove the flag from the flag runner to score 35 points.
B. The flag is a ball attached to the waistband of the flag runner, a neutral official dressed in yellow, whose job it is to remain fair to both teams while avoiding capture for as long as possible.

**FOULS OVERVIEW**

From the time that players enter the player area for a game until after the game has ended, players are forbidden from taking certain actions called fouls. Players who commit a foul face different consequences depending on the severity of the offense.

Back to hoops

A back to hoops foul indicates that a player must cease active play and complete the knockout procedure (See: 5.3.1. Knockout procedure).

Blue card

A blue card indicates that a player must spend one minute of game time in the penalty box and the player’s team must play a player down for this minute. If the opposing team scores before the minute expires, the player may be released early and re-enter play. Blue cards do not stack to become higher penalties.

Yellow card

A yellow card indicates that a player must spend one minute of game time in the penalty box and the player’s team must play a player down for this minute. If the opposing team scores before the minute expires, the player may be released from the penalty box early and re-enter play. A player who receives three yellow cards in a single game must be issued a red card instead of their third yellow card.

Red card

A red card indicates that a player is barred from the rest of the game and the player’s team must play a player down for two full minutes of game time.

Ejection

A referee may eject a player for egregious violations of the rules.

⚑ *Yellow Card*—Using a ball to intentionally interact with the flag runner

7.1.2. Interpositional ball interactions

Players may not possess, touch, kick, throw, or in any way use a ball not associated with their position. The following guidelines apply:

A. Any mounted player who may not play the Quadball must take any and all reasonable actions to avoid a propelled Quadball. Not doing so and being hit is failure to avoid a propelled Quadball.
i. It is a minor failure to avoid a propelled Quadball if the player attempted to avoid it and failed, but the overall play was not affected.
ii. Intentionally moving into, or remaining in, the path of the Quadball to block it or preventing a goal is interpositional ball interference.
iii.A player unaware of an incoming Quadball is not penalized for not avoiding it unless they have acted to ensure they would be unaware.
a. If the player acted to ensure they would be unaware, the interaction shall be treated as intentional.
iv. A player without time to reasonably avoid an incoming Quadball is not penalized for failing to avoid it.
B. Any mounted player may allow a live dodgeball to hit them or intentionally get in the way of a live dodgeball.
i. Players may allow a live dodgeball to bounce off of any part of their body or equipment at any angle. Any attempt to propel a live dodgeball with any part of their body is a dodgeball swat.

1. A seeker may swat a dodgeball as long as the final motion before contacting the dodgeball begins before they are stuck (natural motion).

   b. A player other than a beater or seeker swatting a dodgeball is illegal dodgeball interference.

   c. Intentionally interacting with a dead dodgeball is illegal dodgeball interference.

   1\. If the referee determines that the player was not reasonably aware that the dodgeball was dead and the play was otherwise legal, the player shall not be penalized.

C. Any position’s players may legally possess a dead Quadball to return it to the formerly defending keeper after a score (See: 4.2.1. Dead Quadball).
D. Any other intentional interaction with a ball not associated with one’s position is interpositional ball interference.
E. Unintentionally and illegally acting on a ball not associated with one’s position in a manner that significantly affects the position or trajectory of that ball is incidental interpositional ball interference and results in the turnover of the affected ball.
F. Intentionally blocking a score by committing interpositional ball interference is intentionally and illegally blocking a score.

7.1.5. Kicking

A. Players may kick any ball, other than the flag, which they may legally possess.

**7.2. KEEPER ZONE**

7.2.1. Inside the keeper zone

A keeper with all parts of their body touching behind their own keeper zone line is considered to be in the keeper zone until they touch on or outside the keeper zone line.

7.2.2. Keeper-specific powers

A keeper within their own keeper zone, except in the situation described in 7.2.2.B., is considered to be a protected keeper.

A. A protected keeper has the following powers:

i. While a protected keeper has sole possession of the Quadball, opposing players may not contact, interact with, or attempt to steal the Quadball from the keeper (See: 6.1.1. Illegal physical contact).

a. Sole possession of the Quadball must be established before this immunity from contact goes into effect.

ii. A protected keeper is immune from being knocked out by live dodgeballs.

B. Once any player on the keeper’s team possesses the (live) Quadball outside their keeper zone:

i. The keeper loses all powers listed above.

i. The opposing team is the “defensive team.”

**7.4. PACE OF PLAY**

7.4.1. Delay of game

Delay of game is defined as an attempt to stop or significantly impede the Quadball game from continuing. The exact determination of what constitutes delay of game is at the discretion of the referee, within the following guidelines:

A. A beater or beaters may guard a Quadball to prevent the opposing team from gaining possession of it. However, a beater commits delay of game if they continue to protect the Quadball while their Chasers are making no reasonable attempt to retrieve it.
B. Keeper delays:
i. A protected keeper must directly and immediately advance the Quadball out of the keeper zone, attempt to complete a pass, or drop the Quadball to the ground.
ii. After a goal, the keeper on the formerly defensive team must not substitute out of the game until they have made the Quadball live.
C. The Quadball carrier must at least advance the Quadball at a normal walking pace until they have crossed the midfield line.
i. If the Quadball carrier is taking a non direct path, their forward progress must equal or exceed the forward progress of a normal walking pace on a path perpendicular to the midfield line.
ii. If the Quadball carrier is blocked by a defender, they may temporarily delay their forward progress but must clearly attempt to find a way to bypass the defender.
a. The Quadball carrier is considered blocked by a defender if that defender is between the Quadball carrier and any part of the defender’s endline and that defender is:
1\. An opposing chaser or keeper within approximately 2 yards of the Quadball carrier.
2\. An opposing beater in possession of a dodgeball within approximately 4 yards of the Quadball carrier.

D. Stalling:

i. On each drive, the Chasers on the offensive team must act with the overall primary intent to score. Players in possession of the Quadball may not act with the overall primary intent to waste time for any reason.

E. The head referee may issue a warning when the referee determines that the team is beginning to delay the game.

i. Teams must respond immediately to this warning to avoid a penalty for delay of game. Multiple warnings may be given for delay of game during a single game, as the referee determines to be appropriate.

⚑ *Blue Card and Quadball Turnover*—Delay of game

7.4.2. Stalled Quadball

A Quadball is considered stalled if the player(s) touching it is also touching the ground with any body parts other than their feet or hands and is in contact with an opposing player.

A. Upon a Quadball becoming stalled, a head referee must begin counting down from ten silently. If the Quadball is still stalled at the count of six, the head referee must count down from five out loud.

i. If the Quadball ceases to be stalled at any point before the count of zero, the head referee ends their count.
B. After the count of zero the head referee stops play and turns the Quadball over to the keeper defending the half the Quadball is currently in, in their keeper zone.

i. If the keeper is not in their keeper zone, they shall be moved to the center hoop.

ii. If the keeper is currently knocked out, they shall be remounted at the center hoop.

iii. The keeper shall receive immunity (See: 7.2.2 Keeper-specific powers.)

7.4.3. Restrictor Lines

Teams are partially restricted from carrying or propelling the Quadball backward toward their own hoops. The following rules apply:

A. Each team has two restrictor lines during their drives, each of which extend completely across the width of the pitch at:

i. The team’s own keeper zone line is a hard restrictor line.

ii. The midfield line is a soft restrictor line.
B. The Quadball is considered to have crossed a restrictor line when it touches either the ground or an object or person that is on or past the line.  
i. A player touching the ground on both sides of the restrictor line is considered to have crossed the line.  
C. The Quadball cannot be moved backwards across the hard restrictor line with the following exceptions:  
i. The first action of a drive; either by throwing the ball or by walking it backwards if:

1. The ball does not also cross the midpoint restrictor line.  
   ii. A defensive player deflects the Quadball, during or after the propulsion.  
   iii.A defensive player strips the Quadball.

D. If an offensive player carries or propels the Quadball backward across the midpoint line for any reason, it shall be ruled a reset, with the following exceptions:

i. If a defensive player deflects the Quadball, during or after the propulsion and before it travels backward across a restrictor line, this shall not be considered a reset.

a. This includes deflections done with a dodgeball.
ii. If a defender forces the Quadball carrier backwards across the midpoint line through physical contact or strips the Quadball causing it to travel across the midpoint line, this shall not immediately be considered a reset.

a. Once the Quadball carrier is free from contact they or their teammates must act to carry or propel the Quadball forward across the midpoint restrictor line.

1.The referee will start a three second count down as soon as contact ends. If the Quadball is not across the midpoint restrictor line by the time the referee says “Zero”,  it shall be considered a reset.

iii.The player who initiates a drive may carry or propel the Quadball backwards across one restrictor line immediately upon the beginning of the drive without it counting as a reset.  
a. If the player started the drive while engaged in physical contact with an opponent, they may carry or propel the Quadball backwards across the midpoint line during or immediately after that contact without it counting as a reset, provided they did not significantly advance the Quadball during that contact.

b. This does not apply to the start of the first drive of the game

iv. This action is still subject to all other rules, including delay of game and stalling.

E. Upon the first legal reset of each drive, the head referee shall loudly declare “reset used” and signal the same by swinging one arm out, palm down, toward the offensive team’s hoops.

F. There are two types of illegally crossing restrictor lines:

i. It is illegal to reset the Quadball more than once on a single drive.

ii. It is illegal to move backwards across over your own keeper zone line.

G. If an illegal crossing of restrictor lines is called, play must be stopped.

i. If the opposing team would clearly recover the Quadball without the turnover call, the referee may allow play to continue under a “no harm no foul” call.
